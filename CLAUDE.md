## Identity

**Project name (in all docs and the published artifact): `zwasm`.**
Binary / package: `zwasm`.

This branch is a ground-up redesign of zwasm on top of v1 git history
(commit 517cc5a, charter):

- Working dir: `~/Documents/MyProducts/zwasm_from_scratch/` (distinct
  from `~/Documents/MyProducts/zwasm/`, the read-only v1 reference clone).
- Branch: `zwasm-from-scratch`. **Never push to `main`**; push to
  `zwasm-from-scratch` only with explicit user approval (or autonomously
  inside `/continue`). `--force` always forbidden.
- v1 ABI compatibility is out of scope; breaking the surfaces (C/Zig/CLI)
  for the right design is allowed (ADR-0156). `docs/migration_v1_to_v2.md`
  exists; **the loop never cuts a release** — tag/publish/cutover are
  manual, user-only (ADR-0156).

Read-only reference clones: `~/Documents/OSS/` + `zwasm/` (v1) +
`ClojureWasmFromScratch/`. Full list at
[`.dev/reference_clones.md`](.dev/reference_clones.md); mirrored in
`additionalDirectories` setting. Never edit or commit from these
paths. Pre-redesign investigation: `~/zwasm/private/v2-investigation/`.

## Language policy

Public project. **English by default** for code, comments, identifiers,
commit messages, README, ROADMAP, ADRs, `.dev/`, `.claude/`, all config.
**Japanese** for chat replies only. Enforced by
[`.claude/output_styles/japanese.md`](.claude/output_styles/japanese.md)
+ SessionStart hook.

**Bilingual exception**: meta-prose pointers ("詳細は <ref> を参照。")
and culturally-loaded one-word labels (例: 気付いたら即追加, 裏取り)
where they anchor a concept more cleanly. Never in normative rule
text or code identifiers.

## Frozen loop invariants (read once per session)

- **No autonomous release (ADR-0156)**: the loop NEVER tags, publishes,
  or cuts over to `main`, and **no release gate exists** as a loop
  construct. Phase 16 = completion finalization (完成形): surface audits
  (C/Zig/CLI — あるべき論 + industry-standard, breaking-allowed, NOT v1
  parity) + dogfooding + memory-safety + debt repayment, pursued
  indefinitely. Tag/publish/cutover/version come only from an explicit
  user message. Don't march toward "ready to release."
- **`/continue` re-arm = `ScheduleWakeup(delaySeconds=60,
  prompt="/continue")`** — literal `60` is harness runtime floor
  (clamp `[60, 3600]`). The tool description's "default 1200-1800s"
  does NOT apply here. Full reasoning:
  [`.claude/skills/continue/LOOP.md`](.claude/skills/continue/LOOP.md)
  §"Self-perpetuation".
- **ROADMAP §18 amendment**: routine `[x]` flips + SHA backfills + next
  phase table expansion = no ADR. Deviation in §1 / §2 (P/A) / §4
  (architecture / Zone / ZirOp) / §5 (layout) / §9 phase scope/exit /
  §11 / §14 forbidden list = file `.dev/decisions/NNNN_<slug>.md` per
  §18.2 FIRST. **Carve-out (ADR-0132)**: re-sequencing/re-scoping the
  ROADMAP because a phase's exit/scope references genuinely-later-phase
  work (§18.1 first bullet) is **AUTONOMOUS** — file the ADR + §18.2
  four-step + forward-ref each deferred item to its true phase, and
  proceed without stopping (no user-flip). Default posture =
  autonomous-with-ADR; surface only for bucket-2/3 genuine blocks.
- **3-host gate**: Mac aarch64 + `ubuntunote` Linux x86_64 (SSH) +
  `windowsmini` SSH. Per-chunk autonomous = 2-host (Mac + ubuntunote)
  per ADR-0049 + ADR-0067. windowsmini = phase boundary. OrbStack
  retired from per-chunk gate per ADR-0067 (D-134); scratch only.
- **Context budget**: the **1M** window is in effect (the prior 200K pin
  `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT=1` was removed 2026-05-31 — it made the
  window hit 100% fast and the squeeze, not the working set, was the felt
  pain). The real levers are **structural, not a window cap**: (1) lean
  auto-loaded rules — `.claude/rules/*.md` are injected IN FULL by their
  `paths:` frontmatter glob, so each carries only the load-bearing
  invariant + enforcement pointer; verbose rationale lives in
  `.claude/references/*.md` (no frontmatter → on-demand read only); (2)
  fork big reads/surveys to subagents AND have them return ≤30-line
  summaries (the report returns into main context too); (3) keep
  `.dev/handover.md` current (SessionStart + `PostCompact` re-inject it
  via `scripts/print_handover_brief.sh`). Unused MCP plugins off in
  `settings.local.json`. Full rationale: `.claude/references/context_budget.md`.

## Working agreement (short list)

- TDD: red → green → refactor.
- **Design priority (ADR-0153)**: the bar is clean final design +
  full-featured + 100% spec + **lightweight-yet-fast**. A *measured*
  structural deficiency in one of those — esp. a v1-parity miss (§1.2)
  rooted in a deliberate v2 simplification — **schedules a rework, not a
  defer-past-v0.1.0** (v0.1.0 is not urgent; correctness + design
  quality gate, not the date). Run it as a correctness-first
  **rework campaign** per
  [`continue/REWORK.md`](.claude/skills/continue/REWORK.md) (I+II hard
  gates before redesign code), WITHIN single-pass P3/P6 (no optimising
  tier). Never over correctness.
- Step 0 Survey before each task per
  [`textbook_survey.md`](.claude/rules/textbook_survey.md). No copy-paste
  from v1 per [`no_copy_from_v1.md`](.claude/rules/no_copy_from_v1.md).
- Commit at natural granularity. `private/` is gitignored agent scratch
  (not authoritative; promote to ROADMAP/ADR/lesson/debt/handover if it
  matters).
- Subagent fork for: Step 0 surveys, large test logs (>200 lines),
  cross-codebase searches (>5 files), audit/simplify/security-review
  fan-out.
- Debt + lessons live in git: [`.dev/debt.yaml`](.dev/debt.yaml) (ledger,
  refresh per `/continue` Step 0.5), [`.dev/lessons/`](.dev/lessons/)
  (re-derivable observations, INDEX.md is the keyword index for Step
  0.4).
- Don't paper over absences. Walk the 3-step procedure in
  [`extended_challenge.md`](.claude/rules/extended_challenge.md) before
  declaring something missing or shipping a SKIP-X workaround.
- Bound every backgrounded long-runner with `timeout` per
  [`orphan_prevention.md`](.claude/rules/orphan_prevention.md). The
  remote gates self-guard via `scripts/orphan_guard.sh` (reap + bound);
  compounds with Microsoft Defender's `.zig-cache`/`zig-out` scan
  (cf. D-028) so orphans hurt double here.

## Skills

- [`continue`](.claude/skills/continue/SKILL.md) — autonomous resume +
  per-task TDD loop. Triggers on "続けて" / "/continue" / "resume".
  Stop conditions in
  [`STOP_BUCKETS.md`](.claude/skills/continue/STOP_BUCKETS.md).
- [`audit_scaffolding`](.claude/skills/audit_scaffolding/SKILL.md) —
  adaptive audit (staleness / bloat / lies / debt+lessons coherence /
  extended-challenge consistency) across CLAUDE.md, `.dev/`, `.claude/`,
  `scripts/`.
- [`debug_jit_auto`](.claude/skills/debug_jit_auto/SKILL.md) — SEGV /
  miscompile / runtime-crash investigation toolkit.

## Layout (pointer)

`src/` Zig source (parse / validate / ir / runtime / instruction /
feature / engine / interp / wasi / api / cli / diagnostic / support /
platform — shape per ADR-0023 + ADR-0024).
`include/` public C headers. `build.zig` build script. `flake.nix` Nix
dev shell pinned to Zig 0.16.0.
`.dev/` ROADMAP + handover + debt + lessons + decisions + phase_log +
setup docs.
`.claude/` settings, skills, rules, output styles.
`scripts/` gate, zone_check, file_size_check, bench, run_remote_*, ...
`test/` unified `zig build test-all` aggregator + per-layer suites.
`bench/` append-only benchmark history. `private/` gitignored scratch.

## Build & test (pointer)

```sh
zig build               # compile
zig build test          # unit tests
zig build test-spec     # spec testsuite
zig build test-all      # all enabled layers
zig fmt src/            # format
```

3-host invocation discipline in
[`GATE.md`](.claude/skills/continue/GATE.md).

Realworld `.wasm` fixtures are generated on the **Mac host only** via
`nix develop .#gen` (emcc / tinygo / rustc-wasm / go / clang+lld, pinned
in `flake.nix`); the committed `.wasm` runs on the test hosts through the
Zig-built edge-runner (no toolchain there). See
[`.dev/toolchain_provisioning.md`](.dev/toolchain_provisioning.md).

## Pre-commit gate

[`scripts/gate_commit.sh`](scripts/gate_commit.sh) — full local gate
(`zig build test`, `zone_check`, `file_size_check`, `spill_aware_check`,
`zig build lint`). `/continue` runs per-task; manual commits call before
`git commit`.

Per-chunk parallel host gate = 2-host (Mac + ubuntunote). windowsmini
reconciliation = phase boundary. Strict 3-host `test-all` = A13 merge
gate (any `main` push); automated by `scripts/gate_merge.sh`.
