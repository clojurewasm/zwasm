//! ARM64 emit pass — control-flow label + branch-fixup types.
//!
//! Per ADR-0023 §3 reference table + ADR-0021 sub-deliverable b
//! (emit.zig 9-module split): extracted from
//! the previous monolithic `emit.zig` so the control-flow
//! patching machinery has a discoverable home and so emit.zig
//! itself can shrink toward the < 1000 LOC orchestrator goal.
//!
//! ADR-0014 §6.K.5 + `.claude/rules/single_slot_dual_meaning.md`:
//! the `merge_top_vreg` slot is load-bearing for the D-027 fix
//! (`(if (result T))` arm convergence); a future change that
//! merges it with another field is a §14 violation.
