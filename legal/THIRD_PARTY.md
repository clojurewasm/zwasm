# Third-party components

zwasm is licensed under Apache-2.0 (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)). Every
third-party artifact vendored into this tree is **also Apache-2.0**, so the
whole tree is license-uniform. This file is the running inventory.

> Maintenance rule: when you add an Apache-2.0 third-party artifact, add one
> row here. Anything not under Apache-2.0 does not belong in the tree (e.g.
> the GPLv2-tainted `bz2` sightglass bench was dropped — see
> `bench/sightglass/PROVENANCE.txt`).
