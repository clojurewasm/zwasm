# Optimisation log — Adopted / Rejected / Deferred ledger

> **Doc-state**: ACTIVE — load-bearing reference (Phase 9+ scope).

> **Tracker for optimisation candidates and decisions from Phase 8
> onward**. The Phase 7 baseline (interpreter + naive JIT) is the
> measurement zero; `bench/` hyperfine numbers are the adoption
> evidence.
>
> v1 had multiple "interpreter-was-actually-fast" data points
> (W43/W44/W45 family hoists, coalescer, address-mode folding,
> etc.). v2 captures these as **Adopted / Rejected / Deferred**
> rows so a later session never has to rediscover "we tried this
> and rejected it" — the W54-class regression we are explicitly
> structured to prevent.

## Edit rules

- One candidate = one row. Phase / cost estimate / expected gain
  / status / refs.
- Status is one of `Adopted` / `Rejected` / `Deferred` /
  `Investigating`.
- `Adopted` rows must cite the implementing commit SHA.
  `Rejected` rows must point at an ADR or lesson when the
  reasoning is reusable; lesson is mandatory if the rejection
  surfaces a non-obvious general principle.
- `Deferred` rows **must** include a concrete trigger condition
  (e.g. "when bench shows op X is hot", "after Wasm 3.0 SIMD
  proposal lands", "when FFI overhead exceeds 10%"). Vague
  "later" is not allowed.
- Add candidates **the moment you think of one**. Whether to
  implement is a separate decision; the ledger is also a
  brain-dump.

## Status semantics

`Investigating` is bounded — when it runs out of attention, it
must move to `Rejected` or `Deferred`. Three resume cycles in
`Investigating` and `audit_scaffolding §F` flags the row.

## Day-1 adopted (v2 foundation choices)

Optimisations that are **structurally baked into v2 from the
start**, codified in ROADMAP §2 (P/A principles) and the Phase 0-7
ADRs. These are not Phase 8+ candidates — they are the **baseline
that every candidate is measured against**.

| R-001 | NaN-boxed `Value` (used by ClojureWasm and others)     | Wasm types are statically known after validation → no runtime tag is needed → `extern union` is the simplest correct encoding (NaN-box solves a problem v2 doesn't have). | (1) Wasm 3.0 GC proposal advances to phase 4 with operand-stack values that become runtime-type-erased; OR (2) profiling shows operand-stack bandwidth is hot AND a non-SIMD workload makes `sizeOf(Value)=16` visible as ≥ 5% overhead. Note SIMD-enabled builds gain nothing from NaN-box (v128 cannot fit). | F-010; ADR-0014; spec proposal phase tracking      |
| R-002 | v1's post-hoc address-mode folding (D116)              | v1 abandoned-then-reverted this. Day-1 ON in v2 is rejected.                | Phase 8 bench-driven re-evaluation — registered as O-001. Decide once `bench/results/history.yaml` covers `c_btree` and other mem-heavy fixtures. | v1 D116 post-mortem; O-001                                    |
| R-003 | Pervasive feature `if`-branching (`if cfg.simd_enabled`) | A12 forbidden list — feature dispatch must go through `dispatch_table.zig` to prevent W54-class contract drift. | A12 itself would have to be retracted via a §18.2 deviation ADR. **Effectively permanent**. | ROADMAP §A12; F-005                                           |
| R-004 | `std.Thread.Mutex` / `pub var` vtable / `std.io.AnyWriter` | §14 forbidden list — Zig 0.16 itself removed `std.Thread.Mutex` and friends; the rejection follows the language. | (1) Zig stdlib reverses course and reinstates `std.Thread.Mutex` over `std.atomic`; OR (2) Phase 14 (concurrency) requires a thread API integration where an explicit VTable struct is no longer sufficient. | §14 forbidden list; `.claude/rules/zig_tips.md`               |
| R-005 | Per-trap-reason individual stubs                       | Single shared stub + Diagnostic M3 (ADR-0028) for reason identification — smaller code size. | Bench shows the trap path is hot AND the M3 ringbuffer write overhead is materially heavier than a per-stub fast-path would be. Re-measure once M3-a-2 (D-022) lands. | F-006; ADR-0028; D-022                                        |
| R-006 | v1's D117 dual-entry self-call workaround              | v2 reserves `RegClass.inst_ptr_special` from Phase 7 onward; the structural cause is gone. | A spec change that breaks `inst_ptr_special` (e.g. tail-call proposal landing with a self-recursive ABI that conflicts) would re-open the question. | `src/engine/codegen/shared/reg_class.zig`; v1 D117 post-mortem; spec tail-call proposal |
| R-007 | Implicit error set sprawl (`anyerror!T` everywhere)    | Per-zone explicit `Error` enums prevent W54-class contract drift at the type level. | Zig stdlib pivots toward inferred error sets as the recommendation (currently it recommends explicit), OR a cross-zone API arrives where `anyerror` is unavoidable. | `.claude/rules/zig_tips.md` "inferred error sets"; ADR-0014    |
| R-008 | `usingnamespace` (deleted in Zig 0.16)                 | The Zig language itself removed it — non-adoption is **language-spec compliance**. | Zig reintroduces `usingnamespace` in some new form. **Effectively permanent**. | `.claude/rules/zig_tips.md`                                   |

**Reading guide — R-001 (NaN-box) walk-through:**
- Today's reason: types are statically known after validation. That alone is sufficient. The earlier draft listed three reasons (memory density, static types, debug difficulty) — only the middle one is load-bearing; the other two were padding.
- Trigger (1): Wasm 3.0 GC is currently at spec phase 3, so the trigger stays cold until phase 4. Reaching phase 4 obligates a re-examination.
- Trigger (2): hooks into the bench-driven adoption process (Phase 8+). Without bench data, the trigger cannot fire.
- Both triggers are currently inactive → the row stays `Rejected`. `audit_scaffolding` is responsible for flipping the row to `Investigating` if either trigger fires.

**Discipline for rejection reasons:** when listing the reasoning,
**name the single load-bearing reason explicitly** — don't pad
with weaker arguments. If three reasons are listed in parallel, a
later reader can't tell which one is the actual gate. Move the
weak ones to "Refs". The R-001 first draft made this mistake; the
rule above codifies the correction.

## Naming

- `F-NNN` (Foundation) — adopted on day 1; implementation is
  done, design is locked.
- `R-NNN` (Rejected pre-emptively) — explicitly not adopted on
  day 1. When a re-evaluation trigger fires, the row is mirrored
  into the candidate table as `O-NNN` `Investigating` (e.g.
  R-002 ↔ O-001).
- `O-NNN` — Phase 8+ candidates. See the table below.

## Phase 7 close checklist (before transitioning to Phase 8)

When Phase 7 closes (= every §9.7 row marked [x]), the
`audit_scaffolding` skill inspects this log against:

1. **Debt × optimisation crossover**: every row in `.dev/debt.yaml`
   must either map to a specific `O-NNN` here, or be tagged as
   "structural defect, not an optimisation". Eliminate
   duplicates — make one a pointer to the other.
2. **Phase 7 prerequisites met**: x86_64 baseline + 3-host gate
   + bench infrastructure are now in place, so Phase 8
   candidates must move to `Adopted` only on **bench-numbers-
   driven** evidence (no gut-feel adoption — the load-bearing
   `Investigating` labels on O-001 / O-007 are exactly this
   discipline).
3. **Design clutter check**: with AOT, Wasm 3.0, WASI extensions,
   and SIMD all on the horizon, every adopted optimisation must
   not break the `src/engine/` zone layering (e.g. O-005 AOT
   already has its slot at `engine/codegen/aot/`; O-008
   bounds-check coalescing belongs in `ir/analysis/`; both
   landing zones are pre-reserved).

## ID conventions

- `O-NNN` is monotonically assigned. Rows are not deleted even
  after `Rejected` — keep them so future maintainers can see
  "we tried this before". Same operating model as `D-NNN` in
  `.dev/debt.yaml`.
- `F-NNN` and `R-NNN` follow the same retention rule.

## Related files

- `.dev/debt.yaml` — structural debt (act-now / blocked-by). Not
  optimisation; defect repair.
- `.dev/lessons/INDEX.md` — observational notes. `Rejected`
  rationales that are reusable as principles should land here
  with an `O-NNN` / `R-NNN` cross-pointer.
- `bench/results/history.yaml` — measured data. `Adopted` rows
  must record before/after numbers here.
- `.dev/decisions/` — when an `Adopted` row carries a load-
  bearing design choice (rejected alternatives matter), file an
  ADR.
