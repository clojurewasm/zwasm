# Deferred Work Checklist

Open items only. Resolved items in git history.
Prefix: W## (to distinguish from CW's F## items).

## Invariants (always enforce)

- [ ] D100: No CW-specific types in public API (Value, GC, Env)
- [ ] D102: All types take allocator parameter, no global allocator

## Open Items

- [ ] W49: Plan C — remove remaining seven `if: runner.os != 'Windows'`
  CI guards. None reflects a fundamental Windows incompatibility; each
  is a shell-script or C-side limitation. Detailed table (C-a through
  C-g, with risk classification and suggested order) in
  `@./.dev/resume-guide.md`. No-Workaround Rule applies: a real
  Windows-only zwasm bug surfaced during this work is fixed in zwasm,
  not hidden behind another guard.

- [ ] W50: Plan B sub-3 — CI Nix-ify. Replace per-tool installs in
  `ci.yml` test matrix with `DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action`
  + `magic-nix-cache-action` + `nix develop --command bash
  scripts/gate-commit.sh` on Linux/macOS, and
  `pwsh scripts/windows/install-tools.ps1` then `bash scripts/gate-commit.sh`
  on Windows. Then mirror in `nightly.yml`. Plus extend `flake.nix` to
  pin wasm-tools / wasmtime / hyperfine explicitly (URL + sha256)
  rather than via nixpkgs revision. Deferred from overnight 2026-04-29
  because magic-nix-cache had a 2025 outage and macos-latest +
  nix-installer-action has occasional flakes — wants supervised PR.

- [ ] W51: Doc drift — README "real-world 50/50 (Mac+Linux+Windows)" is
  optimistic (Windows is 25/25 C+C++ until install-tools.ps1 provisions
  Go/Rust/TinyGo); book/en+ja contributing.md still recommends manual
  `zig build test` invocations rather than `bash scripts/gate-commit.sh`;
  setup-orbstack.md predates D136 (Zig 0.15.2 + WASI SDK 25 stale);
  roadmap.md "Zig version upgrade — High" line obsolete.
  See resume-guide.md "Documentation drift to fix".

- [ ] W52: realworld coverage on Windows — extend
  `scripts/windows/install-tools.ps1` (or split off a follow-on
  `install-extras.ps1`) with rustup-init + Go + TinyGo so
  `build_all.py` no longer SKIPs those toolchains. Each is ~30 lines
  of PowerShell pinned via `versions.lock`. Closes the gap from 25/50
  to full 50/50 on Windows.

- [ ] W45: SIMD loop persistence — Skip Q-cache eviction at loop headers.
  Requires back-edge detection in scanBranchTargets.

- [ ] W47: `tgo_strops_cached` +24% regression post-0.16 (v1.9.1 64.5ms →
  v1.10.0 79.9ms on Mac aarch64). Only single benchmark out of 46+ that
  regressed >10% AND >=10ms absolute. Investigate TinyGo strops codegen
  path — likely regalloc or memory-access pattern change. Low priority
  since 20 other benchmarks improved >10% (GC paths 40–76% faster).

- [ ] W48 Phase 2: Linux binary size 1.56 MB → 1.50 MB (~62 KB more).
  W48 Phase 1 shipped (2026-04-25): `pub const panic = std.debug.simple_panic`
  in `src/cli.zig` + `std_options.enable_segfault_handler = false` (zwasm
  installs its own SIGSEGV handler for JIT guard pages anyway) + changed
  `main` from `!void` to `u8` to avoid `dumpErrorReturnTrace` pull-in.
  Net: Linux 1.64 → 1.56 MB (-83 KB, -5%), Mac 1.38 → 1.20 MB (-180 KB).
  CI ceiling tightened from 1.80 MB → 1.60 MB in the same iteration.
  Remaining contributors: `debug.*` still 81 KB (SelfInfo.Elf, Dwarf, writeTrace
  pulled via `std.debug.lockStderr` → `std.Options.debug_io` default),
  `std.Io.Threaded` ~115 KB, `sort.*` ~39 KB. Candidates: override
  `std_options_debug_io` with a minimal direct-stderr Io instance; audit
  whether `init.io` Threaded can be thinned. Acknowledged as a hack against
  stdlib intent — gain vs. risk needs a clean eval before commit.
  Non-blocking; ceiling 1.60 MB still has ~40 KB slack.

## Resolved (summary)

W37: Contiguous v128 storage. W39: Multi-value return JIT (guard removed).
W40: Epoch-based JIT timeout (D131).
W38: SIMD JIT C-compiled perf — Lazy AOT (HOT_THRESHOLD 10→3, back_edge_bailed,
     extract_lane fix, memory_grow64 fix, cross-module instance fix).
W41: JIT real-world correctness — ALL FIXED (Mac 49/50, Ubuntu 50/50).
     void-call reloadVreg, written_vregs pre-scan, void self-call result,
     ARM64 fuel check x0 clobber (tinygo_sort), stale scratch cache in signed
     div (rust_enum_match). Fixed through 2026-03-25.
W42: go_math_big — FIXED (remainder rd==rs1 aliasing in emitRem32/emitRem64).
     emitRem used UDIV+MSUB; UDIV clobbered dividend before MSUB could use
     it. Fix: save rs1 to SCRATCH before division when d aliases rs1.
     Fixed 2026-03-25.
W43: SIMD v128 base addr cache (SIMD_BASE_REG x17). Phase A of D132.
W44: SIMD register class — Q16-Q31 (ARM64) + XMM6-XMM15 (x86) cache.
     Phase B of D132. Merged 2026-03-26. Q-cache with LRU eviction + lazy
     writeback. Benefit limited by loop-header eviction (diagnosed same day).
W46: Un-link libc — Phase 1 complete (delib 1a–1f, merged 2026-04-24/25).
     link_libc=false across lib / cli / tests / examples / e2e / bench / fuzz;
     C API targets (shared-lib, static-lib, c-test) keep link_libc=true because
     `src/c_api.zig` uses `std.heap.c_allocator`. Platform helpers added:
     pfdWrite, pfdRead, pfdClose, pfdDup, pfdDup2, pfdPipe, pfdSleepNs, pfdErrno,
     pfdFsync, pfdReadlinkAt (Linux=direct syscalls, Mac=libSystem auto-link,
     Windows=kernel32/Win32).
     Phase 2 complete (2026-04-25): remaining wasi.zig direct `std.c.*` call
     sites (fdatasync, fcntl, ftruncate, futimens, utimensat, symlinkat,
     linkat, fstatat) routed through new platform helpers (pfdFdatasync,
     pfdFcntlSetfl, pfdFtruncate, pfdFutimens, pfdUtimensat, pfdSymlinkat,
     pfdLinkat, pfdFstatatDarwin). Linux was already libc-free through
     comptime-pruned switches; Phase 2 is a pure refactor with zero
     binary-size delta. Size payoff measured: Mac 1.38 MB, Linux 1.65 MB
     stripped (vs 1.80 MB ceiling). The 1.50 MB target is tracked under W48.

W2-W36: See git history. All resolved through Stages 0-47 and Phases 1-19.
