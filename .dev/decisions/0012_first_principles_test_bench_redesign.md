# 0012 — Adopt tier-provisioned hybrid architecture for the test/bench suite

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-05-03
- **Author**: continue loop
- **Tags**: phase-6, test-suite, bench-suite, infrastructure,
  follows-adr-0011

## Context

ADR-0011 reopened Phase 6 and deferred the v1-asset triage
methodology to a separate decision. This ADR is that decision.

A v1 audit surfaced two facts that drive the design:

1. **v2 has no runtime-asserting runner.** All four current
   runners do parse + (optionally) validate + (optionally)
   instantiate, but none execute `assert_return` /
   `assert_trap`. This is the literal blocker for the §9.6 /
   6.2 strict close (see §6.J below — Phase 6 requires 100%
   PASS, with the only permitted exceptions being v1-era
   design-dependent fixtures that v2 deliberately rejects on
   spec-fidelity grounds, each documented in a per-fixture
   ADR-defer note).
2. **v1 was 80% planned, 20% ad-hoc.**
   - Re-derive: spec submodule + auto-bump, by-origin BATCH
     classification, in-repo realworld source, `gate-commit.sh`
     unified entry, `flake.nix` + `versions.lock` pinning.
   - Rebuild from first principles: `bench/wasm/` mixed-origin
     flat dir, source-less binaries (`tgo_*`, `gc_*`),
     prefix-as-pseudo-hierarchy, fuzz seed missing,
     `bench/history.yaml` per-commit accretion.

User requirements from dialogue:

- (1) v2's current 4-runner / 4-dir layout is not a constraint.
- (2) Public suites must be reproducible by any contributor /
  CI; origin-based separation acceptable; aggregated entry
  point must be visible at a glance; per-origin individual
  execution desired.
- (3) Tool / platform setup hurdles must stay low; idiosyncratic
  preparation steps avoided.

## Decision

### 1. Information sources — upstream-tracked + in-repo source

- `test/spec/testsuite/` — git submodule of `WebAssembly/testsuite`,
  auto-update via v2-side workflow (re-derived from v1
  `spec-bump.yml`). Replaces v2's current vendored `test/spec/{smoke,
  wasm-1.0,wasm-2.0}/`.
- `test/spec/legacy/` — fixtures lifted from v2's existing
  `v1_carry_over/` that overlap spec testsuite (verified by content
  comparison during 6.B), kept stable across submodule bumps.
- `test/wasmtime_misc/wast/` — sparse-clone of
  `bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tests/misc_testsuite/` to
  `.cache/wasmtime_misc/`, pinned in `versions.lock`.
- `test/realworld/{c,cpp,go,rust,tinygo}/` — sources in repo,
  binaries built on demand by `scripts/build_realworld.sh` and
  also committed to `test/realworld/wasm/` for binary-only
  consumers.
- `bench/{wat,sightglass,custom}/` — sources in repo. **No
  source-less binaries.**
- Generated artifacts (wast2json output, fuzz corpora) not
  committed.
- Every fixture must be regeneratable via a single
  `scripts/regen_<asset>.sh` invocation.

### 2. Tool dependencies — three-tier model

| Tier | Tools | Required when | Build-flag opt-in |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Enforce** | zig 0.16.0, wabt, python3 | Always | (no flag) |
| **Conditional** | wasmtime, cargo+rustup, go, tinygo, wasi-sdk | Realworld rebuild OR `test-realworld-diff` | `-Dwith-realworld-rebuild=false` (default), `-Dwith-realworld-diff=false` (default); set `true` ⇒ tools required, fail-fast at build |
| **Optional** | hyperfine, bun, node | `bench-quick` / cross-runtime comparison | `-Dwith-bench-compare=false` (default); set `true` ⇒ tools required |

`zig build test-all` is sized to run green with only the Enforce
tier installed.

- **Three-host gate**: Enforce tier on all three (Mac aarch64
  + OrbStack Ubuntu + windowsmini SSH); bench steps Mac-only.
- **`versions.lock`**: human-readable pin cross-referenced by
  `flake.nix` and `install_tools.ps1`; `sync_versions.sh`
  enforces agreement with `flake.lock`.
- **Offline / restricted-network CI**: `setup_corpora.sh`
  (introduced by 6.C) wraps submodule + sparse-checkout into
  one command, caches under `.cache/`, supports `--offline`.

### 3. Directory layout — by-origin primary

```

```

**Runner placement rule**: origin-agnostic runners → `test/runners/`;
origin-specific runners stay in their origin directory. Existing
v2 runners are origin-specific and stay where they are.

### 4. File naming — directory hierarchy replaces prefix

v1's `tgo_*.wasm`, `shootout-*.wasm`, `gc_*.wasm`,
`BATCH3_embenchen_*.wast` prefix-as-pseudo-hierarchy is rejected.
Origin lives in directory paths; filenames carry only fixture-
local identity.

```
v1 (rejected):    bench/wasm/tgo_fib.wasm
v2 (this ADR):    bench/tinygo/wasm/fib.wasm

v1 (rejected):    test/e2e/wast/embenchen_fannkuch.wast
v2 (this ADR):    test/wasmtime_misc/wast/embenchen/fannkuch.wast
```

### 5. Entry points — `zig build` aggregation

```
zig build test-all                    aggregate (Enforce tier only)
├── test                              src/ unit tests
├── test-spec                         test/spec/
├── test-wasmtime-misc                test/wasmtime_misc/
├── test-realworld                    parse smoke
├── test-realworld-run                end-to-end
├── test-realworld-diff               (Conditional tier — wasmtime)
├── test-c-api
└── test-wasi

zig build test-fuzz                   Phase 7+ placeholder; NOT in test-all
zig build bench-quick                 (Optional tier — hyperfine)
zig build bench-full                  Phase 7+; cross-runtime comparison
zig build lint                        zlinter (Mac-only, ADR-0009)
```

Each step is individually invocable (`zig build test-spec
--filter add`), composes via `dependOn`, respects build flags.

`scripts/{gate_commit.sh, gate_merge.sh}` stay as **hook
plumbing only** — invoke `zig build` steps + three-host
orchestration, no embedded test logic.

### 6. Phase 6 reopen work items

```

(6.K appended by ADR-0014 §18 amendment; six sub-items
6.K.1〜6.K.6 detailed in ADR-0014 §2.1.)

| # | Action |
|---|---|
| **6.A** | Add `test/runners/wast_runtime_runner.zig`. v1 `e2e_runner.zig` (844 LOC) is textbook reference; re-derived for v2 Zone shape. Capability scope: assert_return / assert_trap / assert_invalid / assert_malformed / assert_unlinkable / assert_uninstantiable / assert_exhaustion / register / action / module + cross-module Store sharing + per-instr execution trace. Thread block + NaN canonical / arithmetic asserts deferred. |
| **6.B** | Restructure `test/` per §3. Migrate 4 `v1_carry_over/` fixtures: `add` and `f64-copysign` → `test/spec/legacy/` if spec-overlapping (verify by content), else → `test/wasmtime_misc/wast/basic/`; `div-rem` and `empty` → `test/wasmtime_misc/wast/basic/`. Add `test/spec/legacy/` to layout. Update `scripts/gate_merge.sh` and ROADMAP §A13 (load-bearing edit citing this ADR). |
| **6.C** | Vendor wasmtime_misc BATCH1-3 (≈55 fixtures: basic + reftypes + embenchen + issues) into `test/wasmtime_misc/wast/{basic,reftypes,embenchen,issues}/`. BATCH4 (SIMD), BATCH5 (proposals) defer to feature phases. Introduce `scripts/setup_corpora.sh`. |
| **6.D** | Wire 6.C corpus into `test-wasmtime-misc` step + `test-all` aggregate via 6.A runner. Existing parse-only / instantiate-only runners kept as-is (the runtime-asserting runner is **added**, not a replacement). |
| **6.E** | Fix root cause of the 39 trap-mid-execution realworld fixtures using 6.A's per-instr trace. Move fixtures from trap-bucket to completion-bucket. Sequenced after 6.A + 6.D. |
| **6.F** | `test-realworld-diff` 30+ byte-for-byte matches against wasmtime (original §9.6 / 6.2). Re-add `test-realworld-diff` to `test-all`. Sequenced after 6.E. |
| **6.G** | ClojureWasm guest end-to-end via `build.zig.zon` `path = ...` (original §9.6 / 6.3). Parallel with 6.F after 6.E. |
| **6.H** | Bench honest-baseline migration: introduce `bench/results/{recent,history}.yaml` per §7; move existing `bench/baseline_v1_regression.yaml` content to `history.yaml` as "Phase 6 reopen revert" entry, delete old file; regenerate honest baseline post-6.E and append as "Phase 6 close baseline" entry. Sequenced after 6.E. |
| **6.I** | `bench/` restructure per §3; vendor 5 sightglass benchmarks with in-repo C source + documented build script. Reject v1's TinyGo binary-only and gc_* source-less artifacts. Parallel with 6.E〜6.H. |
| **6.J** | Phase 6 close gate (**strict close — 100% PASS**): (i) `zig build test-all` green three hosts AND every aggregated runner reports 0 failed (no soft-skip, no "honest close" with non-empty FAIL bucket); (ii) `zig build bench-quick` green Mac-only; (iii) `audit_scaffolding` pass; (iv) Phase Status widget flip 6 → DONE / 7 → IN-PROGRESS (no renumber per ADR-0014); (v) handover retarget §9.7 / 7.0 (= JIT v1 ARM64 baseline, unchanged). The **only permitted exception** to (i) is a v1-era design-dependent fixture that v2 deliberately rejects on spec-fidelity grounds (P1) — each such fixture must be (a) documented in a per-fixture ADR-defer note (`.dev/decisions/skip_<fixture>.md`) explaining what v1 did, what current spec requires, and why v2 declines to implement; (b) physically removed from the active manifest_runtime.txt or marked `# DEFER:` so it is excluded from the runner's tally; the resulting 0 failed count is genuine, not a tolerated nonzero. **Cannot fire until every 6.K row is `[x]` per ADR-0014.** |
| **6.K** | Redesign + refactoring sweep before Phase 7 (ADR-0014). Six sub-items: 6.K.1 `Value.ref` → `*FuncEntity`; 6.K.2 single-allocator Runtime + Instance back-ref; 6.K.3 cross-module imports table/global/func; 6.K.4 `decodeElement` forms 5/6/7; 6.K.5 Label arity formalisation + §14 anti-pattern entry; 6.K.6 partial-init-table re-measure. Per-row scope/acceptance/DAG in ADR-0014 §2.1. Sequenced after 6.E. |

**Out of Phase-6 scope**:

| Item | Defer to |
|---|---|
| BATCH4 SIMD wast | Phase 9 |
| BATCH5 proposal wast (function-ref / GC / threads / memory64 / tail-call) | Phase 10 |
| `test/threads/rust-atomic/` | Phase 9+ |
| `test/fuzz/` deterministic-seed integration | Phase 7 Step 0 |
| Embenchen full perf suite | Phase 11 |
| `test/c_api/` conformance expansion | Phase 13 |
| Cross-runtime bench comparison | Phase 7+ |

### 7. Bench history accretion suppression

- `bench/results/recent.yaml` — gitignored, rolling per-commit.
- `bench/results/history.yaml` — committed, appended **only at
  Phase boundaries**; ROADMAP §9 Phase Status widget references
  entries by phase number.
- `run_bench.sh` writes `recent.yaml` by default; `--phase-record`
  flag writes `history.yaml`. New `record_phase_bench.sh` wraps
  the flag with phase-tag metadata.
- `.gitignore` updated for `bench/results/recent.yaml`.

**Migration of existing v2 bench files in 6.H**:

| File | Action |
|---|---|
| `bench/baseline_v1_regression.yaml` | Content → `history.yaml` "Phase 6 reopen revert" entry; file deleted |
| `bench/history.yaml` | Existing entries → `bench/results/history.yaml`; old file deleted |

## Alternatives considered

- **Source-First Monorepo**: snapshot all upstream into v2.
  Rejected: forfeits upstream tracking automation; repo size
  grows; spec drift becomes invisible.
- **Mode-First Layout** (`test/{parse,validate,instantiate,
  runtime}/`): rejected — same fixture runs in multiple modes,
  forces symlink / duplication / manifest-layer complexity.
- **Spec-Bench Bipolar** (separate `test/` and `bench/`
  worlds): rejected — splits the unified entry point requirement
  (2) asks for; degraded variant of this ADR.
- **Defer restructure to Phase 11**: rejected — restructure-
  then-vendor is cheaper than vendor-then-restructure.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Requirements (1)(2)(3) all satisfied (zero-base, by-origin +
  aggregated entry, low-tier-1-hurdle).
- v1's bench/wasm mixing, prefix-as-hierarchy, source-less
  binaries, and ad-hoc bench history dissolve structurally.
- The runtime-asserting runner gap (keystone blocker for §9.6 /
  6.2 strict close) is named as the first action.

### Negative
- Phase 6 reopen has 10 explicit work items; 6.E and 6.F carry
  genuine investigative uncertainty.
- `versions.lock` and `setup_corpora.sh` are new infrastructure.
- `test/v1_carry_over/` directory is dissolved; downstream
  references (build.zig, gate_merge.sh, ROADMAP §A13, handover)
  need updating in 6.B.

### Neutral / follow-ups
- **ADR-0013 (blocking prerequisite for 6.A)** — runtime-
  asserting WAST runner detailed design. Drafted when 6.A is
  active.
- **ADR-0014** — redesign + refactoring sweep before Phase 7
  (now Accepted, content replaced from the original placeholder
  bench-infra slot). Adds §9.6 / 6.K with six sub-items. The
  bench-infra wiring this slot originally held (sightglass
  vendoring, fixture-selection criteria, parallel to 6.I) is no
  longer pre-allocated; if 6.I surfaces a load-bearing decision,
  file a fresh ADR at that moment under the next free number.
- `versions.lock` introduction inline in 6.B unless it
  surfaces a load-bearing decision (then file an ADR at the
  next free number at the moment of decision).
- `audit_scaffolding` runs after 6.B and after 6.J.
- `/continue` autonomous loop re-arms once 6.A is the active
  task in handover.

## Amendment log

- **2026-05-03 (commit a9d2b34, user-authorised in-place edit)**:
  §6.J close criterion tightened from "honest close" (implicit
  explicit-defer escape hatch) to **strict 100% PASS**. The only
  permitted exception is a v1-era design-dependent fixture that v2
  deliberately rejects on spec-fidelity grounds (P1); each must be
  documented in `.dev/decisions/skip_<fixture>.md` AND removed from
  the active manifest_runtime.txt or `# DEFER:`-marked, so the
  runner's reported 0 failed is genuinely empty. ADR-0011 / 0014
  + ROADMAP §9.6 / 6.J + handover.md updated in the same commit.
  ADR scope, DAG, and work-item shape otherwise unchanged. The
  user explicitly took responsibility for the direct edit (no
  per-edit ADR) to avoid "ADR-of-an-ADR" recursion atop ADR-0011's
  reopen + this ADR's breakdown + ADR-0014's wiring.

- **2026-05-11 (`3d0e8a7c`, post-audit honest record)**: per
  the 2026-05-11 ADR audit (`private/20250511_adr_audit/SUMMARY.md`
  §2.3 / batch_A `## ADR-0012_first_principles_test_bench_redesign`),
  this ADR's §6 work items closed strict at Phase 6 boundary
  (commit `b569b8f` → `0825794`) but several **§1–§3
  infrastructure promises remain unimplemented**. Specifically:

  - §1 / §3 "spec testsuite" — no `test/spec/testsuite/` git
    submodule; no `test/spec/legacy/` directory.
  - §2 tier-provisioning — no `versions.lock`; no
    `setup_corpora.sh`; no `install_tools.ps1`; no
    `-Dwith-realworld-rebuild` / `-Dwith-realworld-diff` /
    `-Dwith-bench-compare` build flags.
  - §3 / §7 — no `bench/wat/` / `bench/custom/` /
    `bench/embenchen/`; no `build_realworld.sh`; no
    `record_phase_bench.sh`.
  - §1 self-promise: "`versions.lock` introduced in 6.B
    inline" — 6.B closed at `1ba505d` without `versions.lock`
    landing.

  Effect on Phase 6 close: none operationally — the §6.J strict
  100% PASS gate fired against `test-all`'s actually-aggregated
  runners (`test-spec`, `test-spec-wasm-2.0`, `test-realworld`,
  `test-realworld-run`, `test-realworld-diff`, `test-c-api`,
  `test-wasi-p1`, `test-wasmtime-misc-basic`). The unimplemented
  pieces are tier-provisioning automation that was planned but
  never blocked the Phase 6 close gate.

  Re-targeting: rather than supersede this ADR, the residual
  scope is filed as **D-074** with the structural barrier
  named ("no Phase row currently scheduled for the tier-
  provisioning machinery"). Likely Phase 11 (WASI 0.1 full +
  bench infra) carries the bench-side rebuild; the spec-
  submodule + versions.lock + install_tools.ps1 work fits
  the same Phase or a dedicated infra row.

  Status remains `Accepted` because the §6 work items closed
  per design; the ADR is **honest about its §1–§3 follow-ups
  not landing** rather than implying full completion.
