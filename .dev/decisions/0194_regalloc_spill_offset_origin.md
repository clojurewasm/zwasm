# ADR-0194 — Unify the spill-frame origin (fix the x86_64 v128 spill OOB; D-461 rework Phase III)

- Status: **Accepted** (D-461 rework campaign Phase III, ADR-0153; 2026-06-16). Autonomous — fixes a measured
  x86_64 JIT correctness gap within the single-pass P3/P6 invariants (no optimising tier, no new pass).
- Date: 2026-06-16
- Relates: ADR-0053 (v128 spill-frame alignment / `computeSpillOffsets`), ADR-0098 (regalloc_compute extraction),
  ADR-0110 (Value=16 widen), ADR-0018/0036 (class-aware slot boundaries). Supersedes the implicit "origin = 8"
  assumption in `computeSpillOffsets`.

## Context

D-461 Phase I+II established (ground-truth instrumented `slot()` dump + the previously-zero-coverage
characterization tests): x86_64 JIT panics `index out of bounds` at `regalloc.zig:222` under ≥7 live FP/v128
vregs. The deterministic regalloc threads **THREE inconsistent "spill-frame origin" values** for what must be one
quantity — "the lowest slot id that can resolve to a spill":

| Stage | Origin used | x86_64 | arm64 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mint** (`computeWith` force_spill_threshold) | `max(gpr_pool, fp_pool)` | 6 | 13 |
| **`spill_offsets` sizing** (`computeSpillOffsets` param) | hardcoded `max_reg_slots_gpr_default` | **8** | 8→OK |
| **`slot()` resolve** (`Allocation.max_reg_slots_gpr`, patched in `compile.zig:274`) | `gpr_pool` | **4** | 8 |

The bounded v128 `spill_offsets` array is **sized** from origin 8 (`n_slots - 8` entries, indexed `s - 8` at
build) but **indexed** `id - 4` at resolve (the patched field). The +4 skew overruns the array, and the
"faked spill" ids in `[gpr_pool, mint_threshold)` (GPR ids 4..5, never minted as spills) have no array entry.
arm64 is unaffected only because all three origins coincidentally collapse to 8 there.

Scalar spills survived because the no-v128 path uses the array-less `(id - max_reg_slots_gpr) * 16` fallback
(`regalloc.zig:224`), which already reads the patched per-call field consistently — only the **bounded array** has
the divergence. Hidden until D-460 high-v128-pressure programs first exercised v128 spills.

## Decision

**The spill-frame origin is a single per-arch value = `max_reg_slots_gpr` (the GPR pool size), which is always
`min(gpr_pool, fp_pool)` — the lowest id any class can spill at. Thread it into `computeWith` →
`computeSpillOffsets` so the array is SIZED and INDEXED from the same origin `slot()` RESOLVES with, and set it on
the `Allocation` at build time (removing the `compile.zig` post-compute GPR patch).**

Concretely:
1. `computeWith(allocator, func, force_spill_threshold, scratch_fn, **max_reg_slots_gpr**)` gains the per-arch GPR
   pool param. `computeSpillOffsets` uses it (not `max_reg_slots_gpr_default`) for `n_spill = n_slots - origin` and
   the `s - origin` build index, so the array covers `[max_reg_slots_gpr, n_slots)` — including the faked-spill ids.
2. `computeWith` sets `Allocation.max_reg_slots_gpr = max_reg_slots_gpr` (build time). `compile.zig` drops its
   `alloc.max_reg_slots_gpr = …` patch (line 274); the `max_reg_slots_fp` patch STAYS (it is the FP register-vs-spill
   threshold, an independent axis from the spill-frame origin).
3. `slot()` is unchanged — it already indexes `id - self.max_reg_slots_gpr`; once sizing matches, it is correct.
4. The **mint** (`force_spill_threshold`) is UNCHANGED. It legitimately differs from the origin: it maximises
   register use at `max(gpr,fp)` while the origin is `min(gpr,fp)`; the `[origin, mint)` band is "minted as a
   register for the larger-pool class, spilled for the smaller-pool class" — the array now covers it.

## Alternatives rejected

- **Class-aware regalloc mint** (separate GPR/FP register pools at mint): needs a per-vreg gpr-vs-fpr class signal
  the allocator does not track today (only v128 `shape_tags`). Far larger blast radius; unnecessary — the bug is an
  ORIGIN bookkeeping inconsistency, not a fundamental mint-model defect. Rejected.
- **Eliminate `spill_offsets`, always use the uniform `(id-origin)*16` fallback**: rejected — `computeSpillOffsets`
  still packs scalar spills at 8-byte stride (regalloc_compute.zig:401), so the array is NOT redundant post-ADR-0110;
  removing it regresses mixed scalar+v128 frame density and shifts offsets.

## Anti-regression invariants

- **arm64 byte-identical**: `max_reg_slots_gpr = 8 = max_reg_slots_gpr_default`, so `computeSpillOffsets` produces
  the identical array; the Phase II characterization tests (`D-461 char: …`) + all existing regalloc/spill tests
  stay green unchanged.
- **The Phase II adversarial fix-verifier** (`D-461 ADVERSARIAL …`, currently `skip.blocker`) is un-gated in Phase
  IV and must pass: the x86_64 divergent-origin FP spill resolves in-bounds.
- **The D-461 integration test** (`runner_gc_test` 12-live-v128, arm64-gated) is un-gated for x86_64 → returns 4095.
- WASI/SIMD/GC corpora green at every commit; `check_build_dce` + 3-host gate unchanged.

## Incremental migration (Phase IV)

1. Add the `max_reg_slots_gpr` param to `computeWith` + `computeSpillOffsets`; default callers pass
   `max_reg_slots_gpr_default` (arm64-identical). Un-gate the adversarial unit test → green.
2. `compile.zig`: pass the per-arch GPR pool; drop the GPR post-patch. Rosetta-verify x86_64 locally.
3. Un-gate the `runner_gc_test` D-461 fixture for x86_64; ubuntu confirms on real x86_64.
4. Then resume the D-460 v128-GC x86_64 mirror (the original blocker) on top of the fixed spill path.

## Consequences

- One coherent spill-frame origin; x86_64 high-FP-pressure JIT no longer panics; D-460 v128-GC x86_64 unblocked.
- `computeWith` signature changes (~3 call sites + tests). Small, mechanical, within single-pass.
