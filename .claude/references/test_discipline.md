# Test discipline

Two complementary disciplines: **add boundary fixture when crossing
a semantic edge** (write-time) + **grep siblings before fixing a
bug at one site** (fix-time).

## §1 — Boundary fixture obligation (気付いたら即追加)

While editing code, you cross a "boundary" when any of:

- Encoding a numeric op with IEEE-754 corner cases (NaN, ±Inf,
  ±0, denormal, exact-integer FP edge).
- Implementing or modifying a comparison whose strictness matters
  (`<` vs `<=`, signed vs unsigned vs ordered).
- Touching a spec-defined trap condition (memory bounds, table
  bounds, sig mismatch, integer overflow on trapping ops).
- Adding a new ZIR op or modifying an existing op's semantics
  (especially Wasm 2.0+ proposals).
- Refactoring a regalloc / spill / ABI invariant whose violation
  is silent at the type system but crashes at runtime.

When you cross a boundary AND no existing fixture covers it:
**add a fixture in the same commit**. Don't defer.

### Stress axes (dimensions worth exercising)

Per ADR-0072 §"Invariants in code, not prose":

| Axis | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Numeric range** | min/max int (i32 INT_MIN / INT_MAX); ±0, NaN, ±Inf, denormal; just-inside / just-outside 2's-complement |
| **Alignment / offset** | unaligned load/store (align 0 vs natural); page-edge (mem.size-1 / mem.size); SIMD lane-index 0 / max-1 / max |
| **Register pressure** | regalloc spill-vs-pool boundary (D-132/133); first-spill vs Nth-spill; live-range crossing a call (clobber boundary) |
| **Dispatch shape** | same-module call vs cross-module bridge thunk (D-142, ADR-0066); call_indirect table[0]/[last]/[oob]; sig-mismatch trap |
| **ABI boundary** | caller-saved scratch vs callee-saved invariant; pinned reg (X19/R15) survival across cross-module; signal-handler entry/exit |
| **Control flow** | block / loop / if-else nesting 1 / 2 / N; br to label-stack[0] vs [N]; unreachable-after-trap pruning |
| **Validator strictness** | type-stack underflow at fn boundary; multi-value param/result mismatch; assert_unlinkable vs runtime trap |
| **Cross-module / linking** | host import (Cat III) vs Wasm import; assert_unlinkable error class vs runtime trap; v128 cross-module load (D-079) |

A boundary on one axis often implies coverage gaps on others; a
new SIMD recipe (numeric range) introduces a new register-pressure
profile + dispatch shape. Scan `.dev/lessons/` + `.dev/decisions/`
for prior cases when uncertain.

### Fixture layout

```
test/edge_cases/p<N>/<concept>/<case>.wat       ← source (WAT)
test/edge_cases/p<N>/<concept>/<case>.wasm      ← compiled artifact
test/edge_cases/p<N>/<concept>/<case>.expect    ← expected outputs
```

`<N>` = phase where boundary first encountered. `<concept>` = op
group / feature (e.g. `trunc_f32_s`, `memory_bounds`). `<case>` =
short slug (e.g. `at_int_min`, `nan_input`, `idx_eq_size_minus_one`).

Lead `.wat` with provenance comment citing spec testsuite +
assertion line OR "internally derived from sub-X.Y boundary at
commit `<sha>`".

### `.expect` format

Trap-expecting:
```
trap: <canonical Wasm trap reason>
```

Value-returning (one line per result):
```
i32: <decimal>
i64: <decimal>
f32: <hex bits>
f64: <hex bits>
```

The runner parses `.expect` and asserts equality.

### When NOT to add a fixture

- **Type-system-enforced invariants** — `comptime` checks at build.
- **Trivially-mechanical encodings** — clang-verified + otool-inspected.
- **Internal implementation** not observable from Wasm (e.g. "the
  prologue uses MOV X19, X0").

Rule targets **observable spec-defined boundaries**, not internals.

### Fixture-internal workaround → debt entry

If a fixture file contains `// FIXME` / `// TODO` / `// HACK` /
hardcoded shortcut / bypass-constant: file a `D-NNN` row in
`.dev/debt.yaml` (same commit) naming the structural barrier
(`Status: blocked-by: <specific barrier>`). The fixture documents
the boundary AND the gap.

Forbidden fixture-comment phrasing:
- `// quick fix to make this pass` → escalate to debt
- `// remove when X works` without naming X precisely

(2026-05-04 retrospective regret #4: fixture-internal workarounds
atrophied silently across Phase boundaries because they weren't in
any debt or lesson.)

### Test-side byte offsets must be relative

Tests asserting JIT-emitted byte offsets MUST compute via the
prologue helper, not hardcoded literals:

```zig
// REJECTED — hardcoded
try testing.expectEqual(expected, std.mem.readInt(u32, out.bytes[32..36], .little));

// REQUIRED — via helper
const body_start = prologue.body_start_offset(/* has_frame = */ false);
try testing.expectEqual(expected, std.mem.readInt(u32, out.bytes[body_start..body_start+4], .little));
```

Helper: `src/jit_arm64/prologue.zig` / `src/jit_x86/prologue.zig`
(ADR-0019 / ADR-0021). New sites MUST use the helper. Exception:
opcode-pinned prologue first two words (AAPCS64 fixed per Arm IHI
0055 §6.4) — use `prologue.FpLrSave.stp_word` /
`prologue.FpLrSave.mov_fp_word` for value comparison; byte offsets
`[0..4]` and `[4..8]` stay literal.

(2026-05-04 retrospective regret #6: ADR-0017's 5-LDR prologue
change broke 124+ hardcoded test sites.)

## §2 — Bug-fix-time same-class-cases grep

Before editing code to fix a bug, run a same-class-cases survey:

1. Identify the symptom's **shape** (symbol, control-flow pattern,
   type, opcode group, field-merge logic).
2. **Grep** for that shape (`rg -n '<symbol>' src/` and a
   shape-level regex when the symbol is too narrow).
3. Apply the fix at every recurring site OR document exemption.
4. If the symbol is **near a ROADMAP §14 entry** (single slot dual
   meaning, ARM64-only feature, dispatch-table bypass), re-read
   the §14 entry + corresponding `.claude/rules/*.md` BEFORE
   editing.

Complements [`textbook_survey.md`](../rules/textbook_survey.md) (task-start
design survey) — this rule covers bug-fix-time.

### `/continue` Step 4 inline checklist (per master plan §9.12-C)

When Step 4 (Refactor) involves a bug-fix diff, walk before Mac
lint gate:

- [ ] **Same-class-cases grep** — `rg -n '<symbol>' src/`. Bundled
      arm rename / pattern change → siblings often live in adjacent
      files (e.g. x86_64 mirror of an arm64 fix).
- [ ] **Multi-tag arm audit** — removing / renaming a switch arm
      covering multiple `.@"foo"` patterns → verify each constituent
      independently handled by new dispatch (B109 `.select,
      .select_typed` regression).
- [ ] **§14 forbidden list re-read** — diff near §14 entry → re-read
      `single_slot_dual_meaning.md` / `no_workaround.md` /
      `abi_callee_saved_pinning.md`.
- [ ] **Boundary fixture obligation** (§1 above) — fix touches
      numeric / alignment / register-pressure / dispatch / ABI /
      control-flow / validator axis → add regression fixture same
      commit unless one exists.

Each item is 30 seconds.

### When §2 skip is OK

- **Trivial fixes**: typos in comments / format strings; missing
  `null` check on a single optional with unambiguous source.
- **Type-system errors**: compiler enumerates every site.
- **Refactor-rename**: `replace_all` covers the population.

If unsure: run the grep. 30 seconds vs one re-fix cycle.

## §3 — Inline-asm test wrappers invoking FP-walking code MUST install a sentinel frame

When an inline-asm test wrapper invokes a function that walks the
frame-pointer chain (EH unwinder, debug ring-buffer snapshot,
panic handler walk, any future stack-walking primitive), the
wrapper MUST plant a 2-slot sentinel `{ 0, 0 }` and install its
address as the trampoline's initial `X29` (arm64) / `RBP`
(x86_64). **Never** let the walker traverse the host process's
frame chain.

Why: host-side FP-chain integrity is **not** a portable test
substrate.

- **AAPCS64** (Mac aarch64) mandates `X29` chaining for every
  non-leaf call → walk eventually terminates at a zero-FP frame.
  Tests "work" on Mac and the bug is invisible.
- **SysV ABI** (Linux x86_64) does NOT mandate `RBP` as a frame
  pointer. Zig 0.16's self-hosted x86_64 backend doesn't
  reliably preserve `RBP` → walker dereferences garbage →
  CORRUPTS adjacent state (e.g. per-thread
  `@errorReturnTrace()`) → a LATER unrelated test crashes, often
  in stdlib `returnError` at a tiny SEGV address (commonly `0x9`).

The corruption surfaces as a heisenbug in a different test —
diagnostics easily mis-attribute to the crashing test, not the
one that walked the host stack. See lesson
`2026-05-28-eh-test-wrapper-host-fp-walk-segv.md`.

### Canonical pattern

```zig
var sentinel: [2]usize align(16) = .{ 0, 0 };
const sentinel_ptr: usize = @intFromPtr(&sentinel);
switch (builtin.target.cpu.arch) {
    .aarch64 => asm volatile (
        \\stp x19, x29, [sp, #-16]!
        \\mov x29, %[sentinel]
        \\…
        \\blr %[addr]
        \\ldp x19, x29, [sp], #16
        : : [sentinel] "r" (sentinel_ptr), …),
    .x86_64 => asm volatile (
        \\pushq %%rbp
        \\movq %[sentinel], %%rbp
        \\…
        \\callq *%[addr]
        \\popq %%rbp
        : : [sentinel] "r" (sentinel_ptr), …),
    else => @compileError("unsupported host arch"),
}
```

### Reviewer checklist (apply at Step 4 / pre-commit)

- [ ] Does the test wrapper's inline asm install `X29` / `RBP`
      before calling into FP-walking code? (Search: `mov x29,
      %\[` and `movq.*, %%rbp` near a `blr`/`callq`.)
- [ ] If NOT — does the called function walk the frame chain
      transitively? If yes, the test is fragile; add a sentinel.
- [ ] If YES — is the sentinel a local `[2]usize align(16)` with
      both slots zero?

### When §3 does NOT fire

- Inline asm that doesn't invoke FP-walking code (e.g. JIT byte-
  shape probes that just execute encoded instructions in an
  isolated buffer).
- Direct-call tests that bypass the asm wrapper entirely (e.g.
  `trampolineCore(initial_fp = synthetic, …)` with explicit
  fixture values — sentinel-equivalent control).
- Test fixtures whose explicit purpose IS to verify host-FP-chain
  walking (very rare; must be host-pinned via `if (!(macos and
  aarch64)) return error.SkipZigTest;` with a comment citing
  this exception).

## §4 — Host-conditional test gates must surface, not hide

Tests gated to one host (`if (!(builtin.os.tag == .macos and
builtin.cpu.arch == .aarch64)) return error.SkipZigTest;` or
similar) ARE arch/OS coverage gaps. Each gate falls into one of:

| Category | What it means | What it requires |
|---|---|---|
| **Spec-pinned**: the test exercises arch-specific encoding only (e.g. arm64 byte-shape probes) | Other-arch behaviour is N/A | Comment naming the arch-only artifact + a sibling test for the other-arch encoding (if applicable) |
| **Impl-pending**: the test would fail on other host because the impl isn't there yet | Real impl gap | **Paired `D-NNN` row in `.dev/debt.yaml`** with `Status: blocked-by:` naming the missing impl + `Refs` citing the test |
| **Heisenbug-isolated**: cross-arch reveals a flaky / unreproducible failure | Diagnostic gap | Paired `D-NNN` row + `track_heisenbug.sh` discharge plan per `investigation_discipline.md` §2 |

### Forbidden phrasing in gate comments

- "Mac-only path is fully wired; verify there first" — implies the
  other host will be added later but doesn't NAME the gap. Either
  the gap has a debt row (cite it: `// D-NNN — <one-line gap>`) or
  the gate is spec-pinned with a justification.
- "Linux x86_64 SysV is gated behind ..." with no concrete reference
  to what's gated. If the gate IS spec-pinned, say so explicitly:
  `// SPEC-PINNED: AAPCS64 byte-shape probe; sibling x86_64 byte
  test lives at <path>`.
- Bare `if (!(macos and aarch64))` with NO comment at all.

### Reviewer checklist

When approving a new host-conditional gate:

- [ ] Does the gate's comment cite either (a) a spec-pinned
      rationale OR (b) a `D-NNN` debt row?
- [ ] If the comment says "verify on host X first" without naming
      a gap → REJECT until the gap is debt-rowed.
- [ ] Are there sibling tests covering the same logic for the
      other host? If yes, link them.
- [ ] If the gate would suppress an x86_64 R15-related miscompile
      (per the D-180 case study below), the debt row's Status MUST
      name the gap structurally — not just "Linux later".

### When §4 does NOT fire

- Build-flag gates (`if (!enabled)`-style gated on a `build_options`
  field) are intentional opt-in features; not host-conditional.
- Tool-availability gates (`if (!has_tool_X) skip`) where `tool_X`
  is documented as optional in `.dev/setup_*.md`.

### Why §4 exists

D-180 (2026-05-28) — `runI32Export: throw + catch_all returns 42`
was gated to Mac aarch64 only. The IT-6 BUNDLE CLOSED claim of
"fully wired on both arches" was technically incorrect; only Mac
was wired. When the gate was finally ungated, Linux x86_64 SysV
returned 0 (silent miscompile due to missing `usesRuntimePtr`
entry — see lesson `2026-05-28-x86_64-uses-runtime-ptr-eh-gap.md`).
The gate had hidden the bug for ~2 days. Had §4 been in place,
the gate's "Linux x86_64 SysV path... gated behind the x86_64
op_throw/op_try_table emit which still has open coverage gaps"
phrasing would have triggered a "where is the D-NNN row?" question
at review time and surfaced the gap immediately.

## Anti-patterns

- **"We'll add the fixture later"** — add the WAT today; runner
  wires up later. Fixture is the spec; runner is execution.
- **"This boundary is too obvious"** — value is regression
  detection, not initial verification.
- **"Batch fixtures at next audit"** — defeats same-commit
  discipline; coverage atrophies during Phase gaps.

## Why this rule exists

- **D-027** (twin-largest 2026-05-04 regret): if-result merge fix
  landed for `if` only; `block (result T)` / `loop (result T)`
  needed same fix → extra cycle in sub-7.5c-vii. Bug-fix-time grep
  for "label result arity" would have surfaced siblings first.
- **Phase 8 + 15 optimization safety net**: every refactor either
  keeps boundary fixtures green or fails them loudly. Without
  fixtures, regressions surface only when downstream breaks.
- **§3 origin**: IT-6 cycle 3c-ii (`bcf46f3b` → `7d67e247`,
  2026-05-28). `invokeTrampolineWith` let the unwinder walk the
  host RBP-chain on ubuntu Linux x86_64; corrupted
  `@errorReturnTrace()` state surfaced as a heisenbug-style SEGV
  in an unrelated `error.SkipZigTest` return path. Mac was green
  (AAPCS64 mandates X29 chaining). Without §3, every future EH
  test would pay the same hidden cost.

## Stale-ness

Fixtures stale when spec proposals update (e.g. new trap reason):

1. Update `.expect` to new behaviour.
2. Add WAT comment referencing the spec change.
3. Don't delete unless boundary is genuinely gone.

`audit_scaffolding §I` (ADR-0020) periodically verifies each
fixture's `.wasm` matches its `.wat` source.
