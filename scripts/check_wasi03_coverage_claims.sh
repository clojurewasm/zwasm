# check_wasi03_coverage_claims.sh — keep prose in sync with the real WASI 0.3
# coverage.
#
# As of ADR-0205 (the wasi03-full campaign) zwasm serves ALL SIX WASI 0.3.0
# proposals — cli / clocks / random / filesystem / sockets / http — with the
# official `wasm32-wasip3` corpus 45/45 green. "http / sockets data-plane is
# pending" prose survived the campaign in README + migration doc; an ungated
# coverage claim rots exactly like the D-312 compiler-rt lie and the #163
# default-engine lie (lesson 2026-08-03-ungated-negative-doc-claim-…).
#
# Two assertions:
#   1. ANCHOR — the conformance harness still enables the http-client test
#      (the last-landed 0.3 leg; its presence proves http is served). If the
#      corpus is ever pared back, this fires first and forces the sweep to be
#      redone rather than silently inverted.
#   2. SWEEP — no live tracked file claims a 0.3 proposal is unimplemented /
#      pending / not-yet-complete.
#
# Modes:
#   bash scripts/check_wasi03_coverage_claims.sh          # informational, exit 0
#   bash scripts/check_wasi03_coverage_claims.sh --gate   # exit 1 on any hit
#
# Historical records are exempt: they were true when written and are not
# instructions to a reader.
