#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/run_remote_windows.sh — drive build/test on the configured
# Windows x86_64 SSH gate host (`ZWASM_WINDOWS_HOST`).
#
# `git fetch + reset --hard` the remote clone to the latest
# pushed `origin/main`, then run the requested
# `zig build` step there. Phase 15+ may extend this with a
# `git bundle` path so unpushed commits can also be exercised; for
# now we test the latest pushed state, mirroring zwasm v1.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/run_remote_windows.sh                         # default: zig build test-all on main
#   bash scripts/run_remote_windows.sh build                   # zig build
#   bash scripts/run_remote_windows.sh test                    # zig build test
#   bash scripts/run_remote_windows.sh test-spec               # zig build test-spec
#   bash scripts/run_remote_windows.sh --branch NAME [STEP]    # test arbitrary branch (feature-branch verification)
#
# The `--branch` form mirrors run_remote_ubuntu.sh and is used
# by §9.13-V Phase A.6 to verify feature branches (e.g.
# `develop/value16`) before merging to the trunk
# (`main`).
#
# Prerequisites (all per-machine, none baked into the repo — see
# `scripts/dev_hosts.env.example`): `ZWASM_WINDOWS_HOST` naming an SSH
# alias that resolves without a prompt; Zig 0.16.0 installed remotely;
# this repo cloned at `$ZWASM_REMOTE_DIR` (relative to the remote
# `$HOME`). Provisioning notes in `.dev/windows_ssh_setup.md`.

# Orphan guard — reap prior orphans + self-bound under timeout before
# any work (see scripts/orphan_guard.sh + orphan_prevention.md). Must
# run before `set -e` so the reap's empty-pgrep exits don't abort. A
# wedged windows test-all (debt D-028 >120 min) is exactly what the
# bound + next-launch reap defeat; override with REMOTE_GATE_TIMEOUT.
# Per-machine host config FIRST (see dev_hosts.env.example) — resolved
# via an absolute script dir so any invocation cwd works, and before the
# orphan guard so the guard reaps SSH clients of the CONFIGURED host.
